# My Hometown: Bangalore 🏡

This project was created as part of my learning journey on Scrimba, where I dive into coding.  
I've put together a fantastic guide about my hometown, Bangalore—also known as Bengaluru.  
Discover the beautiful parks, the vibrant Silicon City, popular malls, and yes, a little bit about me too!
